Python 100!

Day 1 

(errors are to be searched in google. stackoverflow is a good website for Q&A related to coding.)

 1) print()= helps you print the desired output.(its a keyword)
             To use less charcters and print different statements use \n in between the statements in order to get output on the next line.
             eg. print("Butter Chicken\nButter Paneer")
             
             adding unnecesseary spaces can give indentation error. 

 2)Strings =a) A string can be defined in single or double qoutes and contains of text. 
             eg. print('She said: "Hello" and then left.') there the single quote is used to define a string and double quote is used to highlight the word "Hello" in that string.
              You can also use the above vice versa.
             eg. print("She said: 'Hello' and then left.")
              you can also use backslash for highlighting a word or a sentence
             eg. print("She said: \"Hello\ and then left.")       

            b) Concatination of strings can be done using a plus sign (ie:- +) in between the strings in order to get a result.
              eg. print("Hello" + "Piyush") but this will give you HelloPiyush as the output. In order to get the output as Hello Piyush you have to use space after Hello or before Piyush
                  or concatinate a space ie:- print("Hello" + " " + "Piyush")  
               only strings can be concatinated not integers.
 

 3) input() = It is used to add a input for  the user in order to pass in back in the fuction {eg. input("What is your name? ")}
              when you pass a input function make sure to pass a promte in it or else it will give you an error {eg. input() will give you an error because no promte is passed in it}
    len is used to calculate the total number of charcters in a string.
    you can pass a string and calculate its length and the print it {ie. str=len(input()) this will calculate the length of given input and result is printed the length.}or you can directly
    pass the len function in the print fuction to get the result {ie. print(len(input())) and whatever input you provide you'll get the len of the provided input string}

 4) Python variables = The variable is assigned to a string or and integer funtion in order to call it further in code more efficiently. also a variable's name shouldn't start with a 
                       number{eg. 1num=2}.If you wanna add a variable name that is descriptive of lengthy you can simply use underscore for the same{eg. ready_player_1}
                       a varible passed should be called with the same name through out.{eg. player1 ="Jack" print(player1) it can't be print(player2)}
