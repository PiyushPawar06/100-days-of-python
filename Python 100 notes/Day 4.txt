  random module :- this is a module used in python for randomisation/generating random numbers per say.randint is the keyword used for genrating a random whole number. 
                   {eg. ran_int = random.randint(1,10) where (1,10) reprensents the range of numbers. } a moodule is basically a part for a larger program which can be called through 
                   out the project when required. for floating numbers used the funtion random.random but it won't give the last whole number of the range provided.while genrating a random
                   float number your can only generate from 0-0.99999..... as the random funtion in float doesn't take any argument.but when required to increase the range you have to 
                   multiple that varible with the desired range say multiply by 5 to increase the from 0-o.999.... to 0-4.9999... 


 python list:- it is used to store a group of info which may or maynot be co related in a single variable in  a form of tuple, meaning a list of some items.{eg. ["apple","cherry","peach"]}
               you can also determine the order of the list where apple is first and peach is 3rd and the list starts with 0 as its index which makes apple as 0th position here. if you
               mention the index as negative ie:-1 or -2 or -whatever the counting of the list starts from the end where -1 would give peach in this case.to add a new item use append which
               will add an item at the end of the list
