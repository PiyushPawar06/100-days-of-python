 Day 3


 Control flow statements:- 

 1) if-else :- this is used when there is a condition and the output will be either of them. the syntax and indentattion is realy important in python. if and else should be written in same
               indentated passion or else it will throw an error. 
              
               comparision opreators are > , < , >= , <= defining greater then,lesser then,greater then equal to and lesser then equal to. != is used to express not equal to sign. == is 
               used for exact/precise value.
 
 2) Nested if-else loop :- you can pass another if-else statement into a exisiting if-else statement. but  the condition  of first and second if statement should true and and for else to 
                           be true the second if statement should be false.
 
 3) elif :- this is used when you want to use a particular range of variable and it can be used as many times reuqired in  an if-else loop. {eg. range of age from 2 to 10 can paly at the 
            swing.
    if height >= 120 :
        print("You can ride the roller coaster!!!") 
        age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
        if age <=5 :
           print("Sorry you can ride the roller coaster.")
        elif age <= 12:
           print("Please pay $5.")
        elif age<=18 :
           print("Please pay $7.")    
        else :
           print("Please pay $12.")    
    else : 
        print("Sorry you can't ride the roller coaster.")}

 4) multiple if statements :- the stand alone if statemnet can be added in an if-else loop but the condition is that you have to indent that stand alone if statement with the if-else 
                              statement that it is present in.{eg. if:
                        (this is the stand alone if statement)---->if:
                                                                   else: } and also all related to  that stand alone if statement should be typed in the same indented line of code.

 5) Logical opreators : there are 3 types of logical operator. 
                         1)and :- if both conditions are true the statement is true.
                         2)or:- if either one or both conditions are true the statement is true.its only when both conditions are false the statement is flase.
                         3)not:- if the condition is true it helps making it false and vice versa by adding the word ' not'.
